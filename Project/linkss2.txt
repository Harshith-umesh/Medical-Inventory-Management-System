				<p style="text-align:center; padding-left:10%; padding-top:2%; padding-right:10%;">I would like to share my personal experience that I went through when my friend was admitted in the hospital in Bangalore, India. One of the young doctors from the hospital voluntarily came forward to donate blood for her and this was the most touching moment in my life. From that moment on I decided to donate blood as frequently as possible. </p>
